This Python program creates a simple GUI calculator using the Tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes buttons for digits 0-9, operators (+, -, *, /), an equal button (=) to evaluate the expression, a clear button to reset the expression, and a decimal point button for decimal numbers. The calculator interface is displayed in a Tkinter window with a text entry box for input and buttons for interaction. The program defines functions to handle button presses, evaluate expressions, and clear the input field. The main loop (`gui.mainloop()`) keeps the GUI window open for user interaction.
